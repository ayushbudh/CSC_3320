  <li>Execute the file <code>hello.sh</code> by typing <code>./hello.sh</code> in terminal.</li>
</ol>

### Lab 7 Post-Lab assignment 
<ol>
  <li>Download the file <code>getphoneNumber.c</code> and <code>calcPrice.c</code> to your local machine. </li> 
  <li>Type <code>cc</code> in the terminal to check if you have clang compiler installed your machine. If not you can easily install it by following steps from this website: <link>https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html</link>. </li>
  <li>Compile the file using the command <code>cc getphoneNumber.c</code> and <code>cc calcPrice.c</code>.</li>
  <li>Execute the file by typing <code>./a.out</code> in your terminal.</li>
  <li>These files can also be compiled and executed in different ways. </li> 
</ol>
<p><code>Note:</code> Make sure that when compiling mutilple .c files within same directory with result in producing only one a.out file within that directory for that particular c file compiled.</p>
